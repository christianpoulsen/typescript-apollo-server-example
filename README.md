# A TypeScript Apollo Server example

The server connects to a MySQL database hosted by AWS's RDS service. So before you can connect, you need to set the needed environment variables:

<code>RDS_HOSTNAME</code>

<code>RDS_USERNAME</code>

<code>RDS_PASSWORD</code>

<code>RDS_PORT</code>

Start by running:

<code>npm install</code>

  
Then to build and start, run:

<code>npm run dev</code>


This should install the necessary packages, build and compile the typescript code to javascript and then have NodeJS run our builed project.
